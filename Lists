## Print a list of three movies I like

fav_movies = ["Dark City", "Penelope", "Labyrinth"]
print(fav_movies)


## Print only the first listed item. Items are ordered zero+, with the first listed item being the zero
fav_movies = ["Dark City", "Penelope", "Labyrinth"]
print(fav_movies[0])

##expected outcome Dark City 

## len is length, which can denote 
fav_movies = ["Dark City", "Penelope", "Labyrinth"]
print(fav_movies[0])
print(len(fav_movies))
## Expected outcome is 3, since the length of the list is three movies. 


## ADD item to a list. You can only add ONE ITEM 

fav_movies = ["Dark City", "Penelope", "Labyrinth"]
print(fav_movies)
print(len(fav_movies))

fav_movies.append("10th Kingdom")
print(fav_movies)
print(len(fav_movies))

##Expected outcome will list all four movies, with added item at the end of list and length will be four. 


## Insert an item into a specific place in the list

fav_movies = ["Dark City", "Penelope", "Labyrinth"]
fav_movies.append("10th Kingdom")
fav_movies.insert(1, "Lion King")
print(fav_movies)
print(len(fav_movies))

##Expected outcome, Lion King is now the second listed movie. Length is now five items. 


## Delete item from list
fav_movies = ["Dark City", "Penelope", "Labyrinth"]
fav_movies.append("10th Kingdom")
fav_movies.insert(1, "Lion King")
del(fav_movies[2])
print(fav_movies)
print(len(fav_movies), "Movies")

## Expected outcome Penelope is missing from list because it was the third item after Dark City and the inserted Lion King
