#A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

#A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

#lambda arguments : expression
#The expression is executed and the result is returned:

#example Multiply argument a with argument b and return the result:
x = lambda a, b: a * b
print(x(5, 6))

#expected outcome 30


x = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
print(x(5, 6, 2))

#expected outcome 13
