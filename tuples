##Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of items. 
##They are similar to lists, but once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.
##Tuples are defined using parentheses () and elements are separated by commas.
##Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.

##When to Use Tuples - Tuples are useful for storing collections of items that should not be modified, 
##     such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments. They are also more memory-efficient than lists.


##EXAMPLEs

empty_tuple = ()
single_element_tuple = (1,)
my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.4)

my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: hello

##Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation
my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.4)
# my_tuple[0] = 2  # This will raise a TypeError


    ##Concatenation: Tuples can be concatenated using the + operator.

tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
concatenated_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
print(concatenated_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)


   ## Repetition: Tuples can be repeated using the * operator.

my_tuple = (1, 2)
repeated_tuple = my_tuple * 3
print(repeated_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)

      ## Tuples have two built-in methods: 

    count(value): Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple.
    index(value): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 6, 2)
print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 3
print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Output: 6
